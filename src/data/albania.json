        "content": "### Passport & Visa Requirements\nAlbania is not part of the EU or the Schengen Area, but it has a liberal visa policy. Citizens of all EU countries, the USA, UK, Canada, Australia, and many others can enter Albania visa-free for up to 90 days. Your passport must be valid for at least three months from your date of entry.\n\n### K-ETA and Entry\nUnlike the Schengen zone, there is no electronic travel authorization like ETIAS currently required. Entry is straightforward with a valid passport at border crossings or Tirana International Airport.\n\n### Customs Regulations\nYou can bring currency, personal items, and goods for non-commercial use. Amounts of cash over 1,000,000 ALL (~€9,500) must be declared. There are standard restrictions on alcohol (1 liter of spirits, 2 liters of wine) and tobacco (200 cigarettes).\n\n### Driving in Albania\nTo drive in Albania, you must have a valid driver's license from your home country. An International Driving Permit (IDP) is strongly recommended as a supplement, as it provides a translation and can be helpful if you are stopped by the police. You must also have the vehicle's registration documents and proof of insurance."

      "title": "Culture",
      "content": "Albanian culture is ancient and unique, shaped by its Illyrian roots and a long history of resilience. The national identity is fiercely strong, symbolized by the double-headed eagle.\n\n### Besa: The Code of Honor\nA cornerstone of the culture is **'Besa'**, a sacred code of honor, trust, and hospitality. Besa means to keep a promise and to protect a guest at any cost. Hospitality is paramount; guests are treated with the utmost respect and generosity. You will frequently be invited into homes for coffee ('kafe') or a glass of 'raki' (fruit brandy).\n\n### Family & Social Life\n**Family** is the absolute center of social life, providing support and identity. Elders are deeply respected. The **'xhiro'** is a beloved evening tradition, where people of all ages stroll down the main streets to socialize.\n\n### Coffee Culture\nCoffee culture is integral to daily life. Cafes are the primary meeting places for everything. Spending hours over a single espresso is a national pastime.\n\n### Religious Harmony\nReligious tolerance is a celebrated characteristic. Despite a majority Muslim population, followed by Orthodox and Catholic Christians, harmony is a source of national pride. This is partly a legacy of the communist era under Enver Hoxha, when all religion was banned.\n\n### Language & Etiquette\nAlbanian is a unique language. Learning a few words like 'Faleminderit' (Thank you) is highly appreciated. Be aware of a potentially confusing gesture: a slight upward nod can mean 'no', while a side-to-side head tilt can mean 'yes'."

    "safety": {
      "title": "Safety",
      "content": "Albania is generally a safe country for tourists. Violent crime against foreigners is very rare. The primary concerns are petty crime and, most significantly, road safety.\n\n### Driving & Road Safety\nThe **biggest risk** for visitors is driving. Driving standards are poor, and rules are often ignored. Expect aggressive overtaking, unpredictable maneuvers, and hazards like potholes, livestock, and unlit roads, especially in rural areas. **Avoid driving at night if possible.**\n\n### Petty Crime\nPickpocketing and bag snatching can occur in crowded areas in Tirana and other tourist spots. Be vigilant on public transport and in markets. Do not leave valuables visible in parked cars.\n\n### Taxis & Scams\nUse licensed taxis (in Tirana, they have red license plates) and insist on using the meter or agree on the fare beforehand to avoid being overcharged. Be cautious of unofficial taxis.\n\n### General Precautions\n- Emergency numbers: Police 129, Ambulance 127, Fire 128.\n- Political demonstrations occur occasionally in Tirana; it's best to avoid them.\n- Stray dogs are common; avoid contact.\n- Solo female travelers generally report feeling safe, but should take standard precautions like avoiding walking alone at night in unlit areas."

      "title": "Health",
      "content": "Albania's healthcare system is improving but falls short of Western European standards. There is a significant difference between public and private facilities.\n\n### Healthcare Facilities\nFor any serious medical issue, it is highly recommended to use **private clinics and hospitals**, especially in Tirana, which offer a much higher standard of care and have English-speaking staff. Public hospitals can be underfunded and overcrowded.\n\n### Recommendations & Insurance\n**Comprehensive travel health insurance is an absolute necessity.** Ensure your policy covers medical evacuation, as it may be required for critical conditions.\n\n### Food & Water\n**Do not drink the tap water.** Stick to sealed bottled water, which is cheap and widely available. Use it for brushing your teeth as well. Food safety is generally good, but exercise normal caution. Eat food that is freshly cooked and hot.\n\n### Pharmacies\nPharmacies ('farmaci') are widely available and well-stocked. Many medications can be purchased over the counter. However, always bring a sufficient supply of any specific prescription medication you need.\n\n### Vaccinations\nNo specific vaccinations are required, but ensure you are up-to-date on routine shots like Tetanus. Hepatitis A and Typhoid are often recommended by travel doctors. Rabies exists in stray animals, so avoid contact."

    "money": {
      "title": "Money",
      "content": "Albania is one of the most affordable travel destinations in Europe.\n\n### Currency\nThe official currency is the **Albanian Lek (ALL)**. While the Euro is widely accepted in tourist areas for hotels and tours, you will get better value and need Lek for daily expenses like cafes, local transport, and markets.\n\n### Cash & ATMs\nAlbania is still a **predominantly cash-based economy.** While major hotels and supermarkets in cities accept cards, many smaller businesses do not. **Always carry sufficient cash.** ATMs are widely available in all cities and most towns; they are the easiest way to get Lek. Use ATMs attached to banks to minimize fees and security risks.\n\n### Exchanging Money\nCurrency exchange offices ('kambim valuator') are common and usually offer better rates than banks. Exchange major currencies like EUR, USD, or GBP.\n\n### Costs & Tipping\nAlbania is very budget-friendly. A meal at a local restaurant can cost under $10. Tipping is not obligatory but is becoming more common. Rounding up the bill or leaving about 10% for good service is appreciated."

    "connectivity": {
      "title": "Connectivity",
      "content": "### Digital Connectivity\nDigital connectivity in Albania is surprisingly good. **Mobile phone coverage (including 4G) is extensive** and reliable across most of the country. Buying a local prepaid SIM card from operators like Vodafone or One is easy, cheap, and highly recommended. **Free Wi-Fi** is also ubiquitous and generally high-quality in cafes, restaurants, and hotels.\n\n### Physical Transport\nPhysical connectivity presents more of a challenge.\n- **Roads:** The road network is a mix of modern highways and poor-quality rural roads. Renting a car is the best way to explore independently, but requires defensive driving skills.\n- **Buses:** Public transport relies on buses and minibuses ('furgons'). The system is extensive and very cheap but can be chaotic, often without fixed timetables (vehicles leave when full).\n- **Taxis:** Taxis are available in cities. Ride-sharing apps like Uber do not operate here.\n- **Rail:** The railway network is dilapidated and not a recommended travel option.\n- **Air:** Tirana (TIA) is the only international airport. There are no domestic flights.\n\nNavigating Albania requires a sense of adventure. You can easily research your destination online, but the journey to get there might be an adventure in itself."

    "adaptation": {
      "title": "Adaptation",
      "content": "Adapting to Albania involves embracing its unique blend of Mediterranean chaos and profound tradition.\n\n### Pace of Life\nAdopt the concept of **'avash-avash' (slowly, slowly).** Punctuality is not rigid. Embrace the long, leisurely coffee culture; it's the heart of social life.\n\n### Hospitality & Social Norms\nBe prepared for overwhelming hospitality. Accept invitations for coffee or a meal as a sign of respect. Be prepared for direct, personal questions, which are a sign of genuine interest. A firm handshake is a standard greeting.\n\n### Driving & Navigation\nAdapt your driving to be highly defensive and alert. Expect the unexpected. When using public transport, be flexible as schedules are often not fixed.\n\n### Cultural Sensitivity\n- Dress modestly when visiting religious sites. In general, dress standards are relaxed and European.\n- Be sensitive when discussing history and politics, especially the communist past and regional issues.\n- Show respect to elders, who hold a high place in society.\n\n### Communication\nWhile many young people speak English, learning a few Albanian words ('Faleminderit' for 'Thank you') will be met with great enthusiasm. Be aware that a side-to-side head tilt can mean 'yes' and an upward nod can mean 'no'.\n\nSuccessful adaptation means being patient, open-minded, and respectful. It’s about flowing with the local rhythm rather than trying to impose your own."
