An electronic travel authorization (K-ETA) is normally required for visa-free visitors (fee ~10,000 KRW, valid 3 years) [visasnews.com](https://visasnews.com/k-eta-south-korea-electronic-travel-authorization/). Note: until Dec 31, 2025, travelers from 67 major countries are temporarily exempt from K-ETA. Those needing a visa (for work, study, long stays) must apply at a Korean consulate.\n\n### Customs\nDuty-free allowances include about US$800 in goods per traveler, plus up to 2L liquor and 200 cigarettes [customs.go.kr](https://www.customs.go.kr/english/main.do).

Bowing (a slight nod) is a common greeting, often combined with a gentle handshake (use both hands for handshakes and when receiving items).\n\n### Shoes\nAlways remove shoes when entering a home, temple, or traditional guesthouse [english.visitseoul.net](https://english.visitseoul.net/index).\n\n### Dining Etiquette\nWait for the eldest person to begin eating before you start [english.visitseoul.net](https://english.visitseoul.net/index). Don’t stick chopsticks upright in rice (it resembles a funeral rite).\n\n### Tipping\nNot customary in Korea [english.visitseoul.net](https://english.visitseoul.net/index). Paying the bill is sufficient.\n\n### Holidays\nSeollal (Lunar New Year, Jan/Feb) and Chuseok (Mid-Autumn Harvest Festival, Sept/Oct) are the two biggest traditional holidays [ltl-school.com](https://ltl-school.com/korean/holidays-in-korea/). Many businesses and transport services have limited hours during these times."

Petty theft is uncommon but can occur in crowded places.\n\n### Emergencies\nDial 112 for police and 119 for fire/ambulance [travel.state.gov](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/SouthKorea.html).\n\n### Scams\nTourist scams exist but are not pervasive. Reported schemes include overstated bills at “tea ceremonies” or unlicensed vendors selling fake luxury goods [travelnoire.com](https://travelnoire.com/is-south-korea-safe-for-travelers). Use reputable businesses and metered taxis (or the Kakao T app).\n\n### Protests & DMZ\nDemonstrations occasionally occur in Seoul. They are usually peaceful, but it's best to avoid large crowds. The border (DMZ) region is heavily restricted; only visit on official guided tours [travel.state.gov](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/SouthKorea.html)."
